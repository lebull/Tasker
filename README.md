Tasker
======

Tasker is a manager of things you need to do.  
This is an excersize for me personally to commit to a project, use common coding standards and paradigms, and to burn some downtime.

My vision of this project is to create a central location to document intended pending action of various projects.
I would personally like to integrate it into my own workflow as transparently as possible while maintaining a connection across various potential workstation.
